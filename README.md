# XmlSchema

ðŸ§¼ (BAR OF SOAP)

ðŸ§½ (MOP)

XML Parser based on Ecto schemas

Parses XML documents directly into Ecto.Schema but with additional layer of DSL to describe
XML structure. All features from Ecto.Schema can be used.

# Sample

```elixir
defmodule Embed1 do
  use XmlSchema

  xml do
    xml_tag :EventHorizon, :string
    xml_one :Single, Single
  end
end
```

(Single is defined in tests/support/single.ex)

All XmlSchema instrumented modules provide `xml` outer declaration with inner
declarations of:

- `xml_tag` - A terminal XML node with CDATA values
- `xml_one` - A tag that contains one substructure
- `xml_many` - A tag that contains many of the named tag

Tags unspecified are ignored.

Above parses:

```xml
<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?>
<Embed1 creator="danj">
  <EventHorizon>No Light escapes</EventHorizon>
  <Name>Bob</Name>
  <Single complete="false">
    <Name>Bob</Name>
    <Address>123 Evergreen Terrace</Address>
    <Address>Apt 123</Address>
  </Single>
</Embed1>
```

and results in

```
%Embed1{
    _attributes: %{"creator" => "danj"},
    EventHorizon: "No Light escapes",
    Single: %Single{
      _attributes: %{"complete" => "false"},
      Name: "Bob",
      Address: ["123 Evergreen Terrace", "Apt 123"]
    }
  }
```
